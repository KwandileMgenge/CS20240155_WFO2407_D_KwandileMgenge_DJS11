## ü§ñ Technology

The podcast app is built using:

- **React**: The core JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **React Router**: For handling dynamic routing and navigation.
- **Local Storage**: To persist user preferences and favorite episodes across sessions.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling the application in a modular and maintainable way.
- **API Integration**: Fetching podcast data from the podcast API (hosted on Netlify) using `fetch()`.

## üì¶ Data

The application works with the following data structures:

- **SHOW**: Represents a podcast, which can contain multiple seasons.
- **SEASON**: A collection of episodes released over a specific time period.
- **EPISODE**: A specific podcast episode, including metadata such as duration, title, description, and a link to the MP3 file.

Additionally, the app makes use of the following entities:

- **PREVIEW**: A summarized version of a show with basic details.
- **GENRE**: The genre information for a show (e.g., History, Comedy, etc.).

### Relationships

- **SHOW** ‚Üí Contains multiple **SEASONS**.
- **SEASON** ‚Üí Contains multiple **EPISODES**.
- **SHOW** ‚Üí Belongs to one or more **GENRES**.
